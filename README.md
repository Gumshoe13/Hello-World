# Hello-World
This repository is tasked with housing all of my learning activities.

I am a High School science teacher wading into the strange and wonderful new world of STEM. My goals are to learn JavaScript, HTML and CSS, create projects and learn how to teach what I learn to others. I am so eager to learn!
